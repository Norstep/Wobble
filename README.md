Wobble is made to be lightweight, modular, and configuration driven. Modules can be loaded via config. Internally the **factory method** is used to construct objects. Interactions are generally taken care of through **observers** receiving messages. Wobble will be built out over multiple phases. Each additional phase will add on more functionality to the core.

*Development will take place in a number of Phases. Not all phases are fully planned yet. There are also no set deadlines as this is currently a side project for the main author.*
