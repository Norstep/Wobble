Wobble is made to be lightweight, modular, and configuration driven. Modules can be loaded via config.  Interactions are generally taken care of through messages but also will support direct method calls for simple interactions (e.g. one shot 2d fx). Wobble will be built out over multiple phases. Each additional phase will add on more functionality to the core.

*Development will take place in a number of Phases. Not all phases are fully planned yet. There are also no set deadlines as this is currently a side project for the main author.*
